Met with Armen. Agreed to initial work of:

1. Obtain data for all open, regional, and games stages.
    a. Men, Women, and Teams
    b. Only top 400 of the open stage. (Perhaps we only need regional qualfiers?).
2. Provide code to obtain this data ad-hoc, without involvement of Don.
3. Provide data in CSV format so that it is consumable in any data processing software, e.g. Excel.
