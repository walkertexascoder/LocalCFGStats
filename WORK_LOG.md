Agreed to initial work of:

1. Obtain data for
    1. Open, Regionals, and Games
    2. Men, Women, and Teams (no Masters?)
    3. Only get Open numbers for Regional qualifiers (originally discussed top 400 but I don't think they would be useful based on our conversaion thus far).
2. Provide code to obtain this data ad-hoc, without involvement of Don.
3. Provide data in CSV format so that it is consumable in any data processing software, e.g. Excel.
