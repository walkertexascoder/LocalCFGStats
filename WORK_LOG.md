Agreed to initial work of:

1. Obtain data for
    1. Open, Regionals, and Games
    1. Men, Women, and Teams (no Masters?)
    2. Only top 400 for Open (perhaps we only need regional qualfiers?).
2. Provide code to obtain this data ad-hoc, without involvement of Don.
3. Provide data in CSV format so that it is consumable in any data processing software, e.g. Excel.
